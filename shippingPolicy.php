confirmation of the payment. 
Health &amp; Wellness will provide customers with an approximate date for the
delivery and will ensure the shipment is sent out on time. In case of delays
in shipment, the customer can always contact Health &amp; Wellness. Delays
could be caused due to factors such as import of the products, courier
partner and availability. All products undergo brand code verification, at
times this could cause a delay in delivery, and delays could also be caused
due to a discrepancy in the order. All products are shipped and dispatched
within 4-5 working days. A normal, uninterrupted delivery takes about 15
days. Health &amp; Wellness strives to ensure all orders are sent out on time
and all customers get their products within the speculated time duration. To
receive your order on time, please ensure you provide us with complete
billing details along with the correct pin code and telephone number. It is
required for a person to be present to collect the order and sign the
shipment receipt at the time of delivery. A customer might have to bear
additional shipping charges if not present at the first attempt of delivery. It is
advised to inform security/reception/neighbours about the expected
delivery in order to avoid the extra shipping fee. Once an order is shipped,
it cannot be redirected to a new address. In case this needs to be done,
one might have to cancel the order and place a new one thus bearing
shipping and handling charges for the first order. Once the package has
been shipped to customers, it cannot be rerouted to another address. For
any such change of address it would need to come back to the warehouse
for the purpose of shipment to a new destination after address verification.
The customer will be charged extra for the shipping to the new address.
Health &amp; Wellness does not have a pickup service, orders can only be
placed ONLINE. Although Health &amp; Wellness aims at providing accurate
images, the final product might differ in looks. We have attempted to supply
the product as accurate as possible and slight change of design, colour or
model will not affect the performance, efficiency or accuracy of the product

in any manner.</p>
